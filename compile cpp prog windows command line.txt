How to compile C++ program through windows command line using visual studio as the compiler:

1. Open developer command prompt VS2015
2. Make new directory (i.e. md c:\program1) or go to existing directory (i.e. cd c:\program2 or ). Note: you can't make a directory in the visual studio
folder which the developer defaults to as current directory.
3. To create new c++ source file or open existing c++ source file in current directory: notepad filename.cpp  
   This opens notepad with either new or existing file. Can make edits and when save make sure is in desired place.d
3.5 Can type: dir   to check what files are in current directory. Should see your cpp file.
4. To compile: cl /EHsc filename.cpp             (cl NOT c1!!). EHsc instructs compiler to enable exception handling.
This will save in your directory and object file (.obj) and executable (.exe) with the same name as 'filename' you picked.

To compile several source files at once (into 1 executable) : cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp      
 Compiler will use the first filename as name for executable. 
To change the executable name use:  cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe   This will rename exe to 'program1'


Microsoft documentation recomends using either /W3 or /W4 warning level to catch mistakes automatically (not sure what kind of things it catches)
Then would compile it using: cl /W4 /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe               (for multiple source files)
  
5. Now when in the correct directory, you can just type the .exe name (w/o typing '.exe') and the program runs. Can do this either in the 
developer command prompt or regular windows command prompt.


6. If copy executable files along with object and source files to different directory, they still run fine.

Press Ctrl C to  abort execution (i.e. if get infinite loop or realize something is wrong)
